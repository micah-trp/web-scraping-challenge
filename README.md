## Overview
### "Web-scraping-challenge" - Micah Raquena

This repository uses webscraping techniques to analyse information from the websites about Mars.   
From here we were able to determine various facts about martian weather and temperature.

See below for outline of summary. 


## Part 1
- File  "Part_1_mars_news_MRaquena.ipynb"  
This section scrapes the Titles and Preview text from [Mars News Website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) 
 

## Part 2
- File: "Part_2_mars_weather_MRaquena.ipynb"  
This section scrapes the table data from  [Mars Weather Table](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html).


### 1. Months on Mars
* There are 12 months on mars
  
### 2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
*  There are approximately 1867 martian days worth of data in this set
  
### 3. Temperature on Mars:
    * The coldest month is month 3, with an average minimum temperature of -83.31 Celsius.
    * The hottest month is month 8, with an average minimum temperature of -68.38 Celsius.

### 4. Pressure on Mars
    * The Highest Atmospheric Pressure month is month 6, with an average minimum temperature of 745.05
    * The Lowest Atmospheric Pressure month is month 9, with an average minimum temperature of 913.31

### 5. Terrestrial Earth Days on Mars:
    * The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. 
      Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
    * Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth.
